	abstract = {Fruit ripening and softening are highly complex processes, and there is an interplay and coordination between the metabolic pathways that are involved in the biological processes. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the variation in the characters and possible causes of cell wall materials and morphological structure during apple fruits development. We studied the cell wall material (CWM), structure, cellular morphology, hydrolase activity, and the transcriptional levels of the related genes in four apple varieties ‘Ruixue’ and ‘Ruixianghong’ and their parents (‘Pink Lady’ and ‘Fuji’) during fruit development. The decrease in the contents of CWMs, sodium carbonate soluble pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose were positively correlated with the decline in the hardness during the fruit development. In general, the activities of polygalacturonase, β-galactosidase, and cellulase enzymes increased during the late developmental period. As the fruit grew, the fruit cells of all of the cultivars gradually became larger, and the cell arrangement became more relaxed, the fruit cell walls became thinner, and the intercellular space became larger. In conclusion, the correlation analysis indicated that the up-regulation of the relative expression levels of ethylene synthesis and cell wall hydrolase genes enhanced the activity of the cell wall hydrolase, resulting in the degradation of the CWMs and the depolymerization of the cell wall structure, which affected the final firmness of the apple cultivars in the mature period.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Groundwater age or residence time is important for identifying flow and contaminant pathways through groundwater systems. Typically, groundwater age and age distributions are inferred via lumped parameter models based on measured age tracer concentrations. However, due to cost and time constraints, age tracers are usually only sampled at a small percentage of the wells in a catchment. This paper describes and compares two methods to increase the number of groundwater age data points and assist with validating age distributions inferred from lumped parameter models. Two machine learning techniques with different strengths were applied to develop two independent metamodels that each aim to establish relationships between the hydrochemical parameters and the modelled groundwater age distributions in one test catchment. Ensemble medians from the best model realisations per age distribution percentile were used for comparison with the results from traditional lumped parameter models based on age tracers. Results show that both metamodelling techniques predict age distributions from hydrochemistry with good correspondence to traditional lumped parameter model (LPM)-derived age distributions. Therefore, these techniques can be used to assist with the interpretation of lumped parameter models where age tracers have been sampled, and they can also be applied to predict groundwater age distributions for wells in a similar hydrogeological regime that have hydrochemistry data available but no age tracer data.},
